<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- every HTML5 file needs to begin with this -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- defines the language of the page for search engines, screen readers and so on... -->

<!-- every HTML file consist of a <head> and a <body> -->
<head>
    <!-- The head contains meta information like titles, meta-data for search-engines, stylesheet-references and so on... -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- information for the browser, how to encode the text -->
    <title>Playground</title> <!-- the page title... will be displayed in the browser-tab -->

    <!-- this is our stylesheet... here we define all stylings for our page -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
    <!-- some HTML tags should not be closed with </xxx>... <link> and <meta> are some of them -->

    <!-- uncomment this -->
    <!--<script src="js/jquery-2.2.1.min.js"></script>-->

    <!-- Our main JavaScript file. This is enough for now. -->
    <script type="application/javascript" src="js/main.js"></script>
    <!-- the "type"-attribute is not needed for JavaScript-Scripts... but it does not hurt -->
</head>
<body>
<!-- the body contains the actual Document Object Model (DOM), which you can see in the browser -->

<header>
    <!-- Don't mix this up with the <head>-tag. This is a new HTML5-tag to define the header of a page. It's just better for screen-readers and search engines. -->
    <!-- here is makes sense to add a navigation, if you have multiple pages... you can do this with the <nav>-tag -->
</header>

<main>
    <!-- the <a>-tag represents a link.... with the attribute "target" you can specify how the link should be opened.
    With target="_blank" the link opens in a new tab -->
    The &lt;main&gt; tag is new in HTML5... read more about HTML5 tags
